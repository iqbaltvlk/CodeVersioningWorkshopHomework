# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

This repo answers the tasks assigned for testing my understanding on Code Versioning 101 workshop. The workshop includes git introduction, operating on git repo creation, git commit, git branch, and git merge. The challenge I faced is that I just realized that a collaborator need to accept my invitation before I can request to review on a PR. However, I can finally send my PR, and assign a review after the collaborator accept my invitation.
